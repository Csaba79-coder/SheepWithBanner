= Custom Banner Generator instead of spring logo at the beginning of your project!!!

use this website (or write in google search: spring boot custom banner generator):

https://devops.datenkollektiv.de/banner.txt/index.html

if it contains not only ascii letters:

https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Big&t=B%C3%A1r%C3%A1ny

after you created you own banner, under resource just create a banner.txt copy in it, save ... and check it out! ... lol.

Is that so easy? Yeap!
